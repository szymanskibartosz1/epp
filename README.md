## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the code, data references, and documentation for my bachelor's thesis titled:

> **"Evaluating Machine Learning Algorithm Performance Across Datasets:  
> A Study Using the Elo-Based Predictive Power Measure on OpenML"**

The aim of this thesis is to conduct a cross-sectional analysis of machine learning model performance using the **EPP (Elo-Based Predictive Power)** quality measure.

To achieve this, publicly available datasets from the **OpenML** platform were used. Precomputed results from models contributed by the OpenML community were utilized, enabling the evaluation of algorithm performance without incurring high computational costs. This not only provided insights into algorithmic effectiveness across datasets but also demonstrated the practical utility of the EPP metric in one of the largest repositories of tabular data.
